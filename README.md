Hi welcome to Fiver's Makan Repository! Our intial goal is to make a webapp that makes it easy for people with dietary restriction to find restaurants to eat in a certain area. Subsequently we added several other features such as reservations and leaving review. See below for more details.

Our website is functional! see link to webapp: https://sc2006projectwebsitedeployfrontend.onrender.com/
